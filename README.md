# 🎬 Netflix Data Analysis – Exploratory Data Insights

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a real-world Netflix dataset. The goal was to analyze the catalog of Netflix titles, identify content trends, 
and extract insights related to genres, countries, release years, and more.

This project was completed as part of my academic training in data analytics.
